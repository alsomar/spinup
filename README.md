# SpinUp
SpinUp is a Ruby extension for SketchUp that enables you to quickly and easily rotate multiple components or groups around their positions.

Some parts of the code have been generated with ChatGPT artificial intelligence.

# How to use SpinUp
To use the SpinUp extension, follow these steps:

1) Select some groups or components
2) Go to the "Extensions" menu and select "SpinUp"
3) In the prompt that appears, enter the rotation angle (in degrees) and the axis you want to rotate around (X, Y, or Z)
4) Click "OK" to apply the rotation

If there is nothing selected in your model, you will get an error message telling you to select something.
If the angle you entered is invalid, you will get an error message telling you to enter a valid angle.

That's it! The selected entities in your model will be rotated around the specified axis by the specified angle.
